🎓 Computer Science @ City College of New York '26 (Macaulay Honors)  
🤖 AI Robotics Research Intern @ Cornell Tech (SROP '25)  
📊 Break Through Tech AI Fellow (Cornell Tech)  
💡 Passionate about AI, human-centered design, and educational equity  

I’m a first-gen Pakistani-American CS student working at the intersection of AI, UX, and social good. Currently interning at Cornell Tech with the [Interaction Research Lab](https://irl.tech.cornell.edu/), I prototype service robots and explore how people interact with intelligent systems through language and movement.

As the **former President of [ACM at CCNY](https://beaverscode.club/)**, I led a 500+ member tech org and built spaces for students to learn ML, cybersecurity, web dev, and more through hands-on workshops and speaker events. Whether designing interfaces or building models, I care deeply about impact, clarity, and collaboration.

Always learning, always building — feel free to connect!

## ✨ Fun Fact

I’m a daily Wordle player who loves using quick puzzles to sharpen my problem-solving skills. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me sipping coffee while scrolling TikTok or randomly binge-watching Netflix shows. :)
